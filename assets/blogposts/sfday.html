			<strong>Saturday April 8th, 2017 || </strong>
			It's weird to think that my friend and I decided to go to San Francisco today while we were on our spring break vacation in Los Angeles. You'd think we'd be focused on our time in LA. Nope! Instead we were lamenting over the legendary egg tarts at Golden Gate Bakery and the to-go dim sum from the hole-in-the-wall restaurant we stumbled upon on one of our first SF adventures. Maybe it was because the food we ate in LA Chinatown was mediocre at best. Neverthless, we planned our SF outing a week in advance, and counted the days down to it.

			Except it wasn't actually planned out that well. We only knew we wanted to go. See, when you go to college near a huge city like SF, you are often daydreaming about going there, but as for your plans once you get there, those are always decided later. There's just something mysterious and inviting about going out of your college town (even though Berkeley itself is an adventure). It's like the last slice of cake in the fridge. It calls to you even though you have no idea how you're going to burn off all those calories later. Hmmm, okay that analogy might be a bit flawed, but you get the idea.

			We went with the intention of going to the Cherry Blossom Festival that weekend. We saw more cute dogs than we did cherry blossoms. Woops. After wandering the vendors at the festival, we feasted on ramen at a nearby strip mall. Full and content, we did what any other foodie would do: we lined up for more food. Okay, to be completely clear, we lined up for Boba Guys. It was my first time and I don't think I'll ever find boba that'll come close to how amazing Boba Guys' boba was. Look at how beautifully those flavors of strawberry, matcha, and boba are layered.

			Now sufficiently stuffed, we journeyed to Chinatown and, you guessed it, bought more food. To our credit, we didn't actually eat it this time. After buying dimsum and getting yelled at in Cantonese, we popped by Golden Gate Bakery. To our amazement, it was open and the line didn't seem that long. LOL. We waited a full hour before it was our turn at the counter. All I could think in the last fifteen minutes was why people would be buying four dozen egg tarts. I don't think anything is more stressful than being one group away from your turn and that group of four girls decide to buy two dozen egg tarts - EACH. They were also bringing them back to Las Vegas. HOW?! Cheers to their skill if they actually managed to get those tarts to survive the plane ride.

			Nevertheless it was still quite an adventure. If you ever go to SF, stop by Golden Gate Bakery. It's definitely worth the hype.
