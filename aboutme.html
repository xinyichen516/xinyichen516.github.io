				Hello there! I'm Xin Yi Chen, caffeine-fueled foodie and a current freshman at University of California, Berkeley who intends on majoring in Computer Science. For more information about my past activities and achievements, I'd like to direct you to my resume, by clicking "Resume" above or this link <a href="resume.html" style="text-decoration:none; color: #767676;">here</a>.

			<p>
				While I was born in China (Sichuanese food anyone?) and raised in Canada (greetings fellow Toronto residents!), I currently call Seattle home. Yet despite having lived there for the past nine years, I still greatly dislike rain, which is probably why I escaped to the Bay Area. I'm an aspiring photographer and software developer. To see some of my fun in the field of photography, visit my blog by clicking the link the in the navigation bar above, or <a href="blog.html" style="text-decoration:none; color: #767676;">here</a>!

				More content to come on this page, but for now, feel free to peruse!
